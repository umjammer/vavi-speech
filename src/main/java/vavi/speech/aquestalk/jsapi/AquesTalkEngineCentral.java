     * and locale (e.g., Locale.US).
     * <li>For all AquesTalk Voices from all VoiceDirectories discovered by the
     * VoiceManager, this method will group the Voices according to those that
     * have both a common locale and domain (e.g, all "general" domain voices
     * for the US local will be grouped together).
     * <li>For each group of voices that shares a common locale and domain,
     * this method generates a new JSAPI SynthesizerModeDesc with the following
     * attributes:
     * <ul>
     * <li>The engine name is of the form: "AquesTalk &lt;locale> &lt;domain>
     * synthesizer" For example, "AquesTalk en_us general synthesizer"
     * <li>The locale is the locale shared by all the voices (e.g., Locale.US)
     * <li>The mode name is the domain shared by all the voices (e.g.,
     * "general").
     * </ul>
     * <li>The JSAPI Voices for each resulting Synthesizer will have the name
     * of the AquesTalk Voice (e.g. "kevin" "kevin16").
     * </ul>
